# How to become an English user.
for Takekawa Sensei's students.

### Why are Americans good at English?
* because they use English 16 hours/day.

Why is Japanese bad at English?
* because we use Japanese for 16 hours/day. And almost zero English.

You can't use both; if you want to be good at English, you have to allocate your time to English.

### Change your mind language to English

We are talking Japanese in our brains all day.  
Change it to English. By doing only that, you can allocate a lot of time to English.  
When you feel "お腹減った", say "I'm hungry" in your mind.

### How to change your mind language to English

Practice "frequently used phrase."  
https://www.englishspeak.com/en/english-phrases  
Download. Put every audio file and put it into your music player.   
Listen and speak what you heard.  
English is a sport, not a school subject.

Within a month, you will be able to speak simple English.

### Speaking is the thing you should focus on

Speaking, Listening, Writing, Reading.  
In Japanese English education, these are handled as peers.

But the most important thing is speaking.
1. It increases the English usage time massively.
2. Mind language change is the most important aspect of language learning, and speaking(thinking) is required for it. 
3. What you can't speak, it's hard to hear.

The next is listening.
1. It also increases the English usage time massively.
2. If you can't speak the phrase, it's likely you can't hear the phrase.

### Forget about writing and reading.
I know you want to be better at it.
But it's like doing application without understanding of basics.

Why?
1. The human brain is not adapted to read/write effectively. It's difficult for us.
2. Language is Speaking/Listening. Writing/Reading is an extra system of the language.
    * For example, the Japanese language got its writing system in the 4th century. Long before writing, people were speaking the language.
3. It will not increase your English usage time effectively. Even Americans can't read and write for 16 hours a day. They can think(speaking in mind) or listen to English 16 hours a day.

### Forget about grammar and pronunciation
It's just too slow and a waste of time.
Why don't you need grammar
1. Grammar can be covered by just practicing the "frequently used phrase".
2. It's just useless in real English usage. When you talk(English or Japanese), you usually have to respond within around 1 second. There is no time to think about grammar.

Pronunciation is useless unless you really need to be a professional English talker, like you want to become a caster.
1. Even European leaders (e.g., Jens Stoltenberg) have terrible pronunciation, but they are very respected. 
2. It's very boring to practice.

### Enjoy what Americans enjoy
For example, go to Reddit. This is American American-origin SNS. 
* https://www.reddit.com/r/all/
It's English, but many of the popular post is simple image or just a few sentences.  
You can enjoy without understanding English. And if you enjoy it, you will like it, and you will start understanding English naturally.   
Watch YouTube, listen Audiobook, or anything that Americans do.

* Google provides high-quality AI for free; it's for developers, but anyone can use it. https://aistudio.google.com/prompts/new_chat
    . You can talk with it in English. Next time you search something, ask the AI in English.

### Replace Japanese with English

When you physically see Japanese, you should consider if it can be replaced in English.  
You watch YouTube in English.  
You watch Anime, use English voice. Play game in English. Read manga in English.  
Change OS to English.  
Just pretend you're American from today.  

Avoid the Japanese language as much as possible.

### So, what should you do now?

1. Buy cheap portable audio players. You want to have 2 of them to avoid downtime.
    * It's important because smartphones are slow, big, and expensive. You want to simple tool.  
2. Download the frequently used phrase and put it into your audio player (for example, https://www.englishspeak.com/en/english-phrases)
3. When you wake up, you start listening.
